      for the beautification of the school campus and thus promote the use of eco-friendly products. 
      The Nature Club has installed waste segregation facilities in the school campus. Also a rain water-harvesting 
      unit has been installed in the campus. Numerous street plays and awareness programmes are being 
      enacted at different public places across the city to increase awareness among the common people. Plans are

    <p>The goal of the maker club is to empower students to become confident creators and tinkerers 
      who can design and collaborate on projects. Members explore everything from building with 
      cardboard to making a working circuit through student-driven and developmentally appropriate projects. 
      Members use science, technology, engineering, arts, and math as core areas. </p>

  <h4>Implemented online Attendance Management System</h4>

  <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy
    Humans are prone to error, even if provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance
    management systems endure accurate time records and minimize the inevitable and errors with manual data entry.
    This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
    <br>
    2. Economics
    Have you ever thought that attendance management systems could control costs? It saves money by putting an end
    to inaccurate time reporting buddy punching, tardiness, time abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact,
    a study done by the Aesium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after
    implementing automated attendance management system.
    <br>
    3. Productivity / Efficiency
    Monitoring and managing attendance manually can be a time-consuming, labourious, and expensive affair. It takes
    time to process paper sheets and time cards, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create
    payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with an automated system that does it all for you, from
    keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into your payroll system. The time and
    effort saved combined with data accuracy helps in optimiting the use of resources which lead to increased
    productivity and improves profits. And many more Visibillity / Insights, Hassle free Workflow Management,
